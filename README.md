# VCU Nanoinformatics Team 

#### Background: 

There is a critical need to automatically extract and synthesize knowledge and trends in nanotechnology research from an exponentially increasing body of literature. New engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), such as nanomedicines, are continuously being discovered and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches can semi‐automate the cataloging of ENMs and their unique physico‐chemical properties. The VCU Nanoinformatics Team applies NLP approaches to automatically aggregate studies on ENMs.

## Getting Started

The project is broken down into the following components:

### [FIND](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/FIND) 

Framework for Intelligent Nanoparticle Discovery (FIND): Front-End and code related to the database/Website. 

### [NERD](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/NERD) 

Named Entity Recognition and Discovery (NERD): Framework to automatically extract nanoparticle synthesis, characteristics and biological effect information from the literature. 

### [NanoDC](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/NanoDC)

Nano Document Classification (NanoDC): Framework to automatically identify Nano-related scientific papers.

### [Tools](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/Tools)

Tools is used for common NLP tools such as coverters and many text processing steps.
