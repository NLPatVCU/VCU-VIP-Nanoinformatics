This is a project by VCU Natural Language Processing Lab in collaboration with VCU Nanotechnology Department.

## Getting Started

The project is broken down into the following components:

### [FIND](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/FIND) 

This is where all the Front-End and code related to the database/Website will go.

### [NERD](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/NERD) 

This is the attempt to create a Named Entity Recognizer for Nano-related things.

### [Document Classification](https://github.com/bmcinnes/VCU-VIP-Nanoinformatics/tree/master/NERD)

This is an attempt to create a Document Classification system for Nano-related scientific papers.
