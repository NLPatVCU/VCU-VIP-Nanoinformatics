- AuthorIDs are not generated correctly. As of now, they're generated randomly. The database is set to "auto-increment" AuthorIDs.
This can cause issues when generated AuthorIDs already exist in the database. The database will then increment it automatically.
This breaks the database connection between "Authors" and "PublicationAuthors" tables respectively. Therefore, when selecting/deleting data
authors might be lingering in the "Authors" table due to mis-matched AuthorIDs.

- With introduction of PublishYear, DateCreated and DateCompleted have not place to store within the database. Therefore, I cannot display them
under WebUI Client CGi script. They are now blank.
