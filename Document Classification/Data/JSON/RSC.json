        "abstract":"\nA new synthetic method for the fabrication of copper oxide nanoparticles and its applications towards the electrochemical sensing of risperidone (Ris) are reported. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by different methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The copper oxide nanoparticle/ionic liquid (CuO-NPs/IL) nanocomposite modified electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of Ris compared to a carbon paste electrode (CPE) and CuO-NP/CPE. The dependence of the oxidation peak current on the pH of the solution, amount of modifier, scan rate and concentration of the analyte was studied to optimize the experimental conditions. The detection limit of 0.016 \u03bcM and two linear calibration ranges of 0.1\u20131 and 1\u2013100 \u03bcM were obtained for Ris determination at CuO-NP/IL/CPE. The proposed modified electrode was successfully applied for the determination of Ris in human blood serum samples without separation or pretreatment.\n"

Colloidal crystalline CuO nanoparticles with diameters of 3\u201312 nm were obtained from the CuCl2 metal salt at low temperature under ultrasound irradiation. The solution-processible CuO nanoparticles are applied as an anode buffer layer in a PCDTBT:PC71BM bulk heterojunction solar cell to substitute the commonly used hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS. It is found that UV\u2013ozone treatment increases the work function of the CuO buffer layer from \u22124.7 to \u22125.4 eV, facilitating the interfacial contact and hole extraction. The UVO-treated CuO-based solar cells show enhanced fill factor and photocurrent, resulting in an increased photovoltaic performance from 6.00% to 6.44% in comparison to the PEDOT:PSS-based solar cells. Moreover, the solar cells with a CuO buffer layer show better ambient stability than those with a PEDOT:PSS buffer layer. The facile preparation of solution-processed CuO and effectiveness in polymer solar cells render it a promising anode interfacial material for solution-processed flexible polymer solar cells.\n"

The as-prepared GSH\u2013CuNCs possess a small size (\u223c2.2 \u00b1 0.2 nm), red luminescence with quantum yield (5.3%), and water-dispersibility. Moreover, the fluorescence of the as-prepared GSH\u2013CuNCs is responsive to pH so that the intensity of fluorescence increases rapidly with decreasing pH from 9 to 4. Besides, the GSH\u2013CuNCs would be aggregated by Pb2+ ions in aqueous solution which results in quenching of the fluorescence. Therefore, such GSH\u2013CuNCs would be excellent candidates as fluorescent probes for the label-free detection of Pb2+ with the limit of detection at 1.0 nM. Importantly, CAL-27 cells are used as models to achieve potential application as probes for monitoring Pb2+ in living cells.

        "abstract":"\nHere, we report a new synthetic route for spherical small copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) with size ranging from 3.5 nm to 11 nm and with an unprecedented associated monodispersity (<10%). This synthesis is based on the reduction of an organometallic precursor (CuCl(PPh3)3) by tert-butylamine borane in the presence of dodecylamine (DDA) at a moderate temperature (50 to 100 \u00b0C). Because of their narrow size distribution, the CuNPs form long-range 2D organizations (several \u03bcm2). The wide range of CuNPs sizes is obtained by controlling the reaction temperature and DDA-to-copper phosphine salt ratio during the synthesis process. The addition of oleic acid (OA) after the synthesis stabilizes the CuNPs (no coalescence) for several weeks under a nitrogen atmosphere. The nature and the reactivity of the ligands were studied by IR and UV-visible spectroscopy. We thus show that just after synthesis the nanoparticles are coated by phosphine and DDA. After adding OA, a clear exchange between phosphine and OA is evidenced. This exchange is possible thanks to an acid\u2013base reaction between the free alkylamine in excess in the solution and OA. OA is then adsorbed on the NPs surface in the form of carboxylate. Furthermore, the use of oleylamine (OYA) instead of DDA as the capping agent allows one to obtain other NP shapes (nanorods, triangles and nanodisks). We get evidence that OYA allows the selective adsorption of chloride ions derived from the copper precursor on the different crystallographic faces during the growth of CuNPs that induces the formation of anisotropic shapes such nanorods or triangles.\n"

The sunlight induced photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of acid orange 74 (an azo dye) by TPPO capped CuO nanoparticles was attributed to unfavorable electron capturing by molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species. This is demonstrated from theoretical band structure calculations which revealed valence band edge (2.59 eV) and conduction band edge (0.29 eV) for TPPO capped CuO nanoparticles, which are unfavourable for electron transfer with respect to the redox potentials of O2/O2\u02d9\u2212 (\u22120.2 eV) and H2O/\u02d9OH (2.2 eV) in the NHE scale.

A similar dye degradation efficiency was observed when CuO nanoparticles were mixed with H2O2 in the reaction medium. The mechanism for the drastic improvement in the dye degradation due to the addition of K2S2O8 or H2O2 has been explained on the basis of favorable redox couples of S2O82\u2212/SO4\u02d9\u2212 (2.01 eV) and H2O2/\u02d9OH (0.87 eV) which could accept photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of CuO to produce reactive hydroxyl radical species. Using selective scavenger for reactive oxygen species, the generation of O2\u02d9\u2212 was ruled out and hydroxyl radicals were confirmed as the major reactive oxygen species for the degradation of acid orange-74 dye. Ion chromatography studies of the aliquot left after sunlight induced photocatalytic dye degradation revealed anions, viz. nitrate, sulphate, oxalate and formate, which are released due to mineralization of the dye solution by a photocatalytic process. The performance of the photocatalytic dye degradation was unchanged for 5 repetitive catalytic cycles and hence it was concluded that TPPO capped CuO nanoparticles offer excellent photocatalytic dye degradation ability when suitable electron capturing agents like potassium persulphate are used in tandem.\n"

Different from the literature that utilized a capping agent bearing only one kind of Cu binding functionality, either an amino or a carboxylic unit, for their preparation and shape control, this contribution reports a convenient method to engage both amino and carboxylic binding units at the same time. In this method, natural amino acids have been chosen as capping agents and demonstrated their versatile capabilities for the preparation of both Cu nanoparticles and nanowires. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the binding mode between amino acids and the Cu surface is highly dependent on their chemical structures. Interestingly, the produced Cu nanocrystals, exhibited an extraordinarily excellent anti-oxidation power. Furthermore, it was found that the multiple functionalities of amino acids not only have a great impact on the properties of their capped nanocrystals, such as solvent dispersibility, but also provide a convenient route for their further modification and functionalization.\n"

The RC of the precursor produced copper species (Cu2O and CuO) in thermodynamic equilibrium, with the major nano-size Cu2O phase having a large surface area, while calcinations in stagnant air at 400 \u00b0C resulted in a CuO phase of larger crystallites with lower surface area.

In addition, the mechanism of the in situ synthesis of nanoparticles within nonaqueous ionic liquid microemulsions was discussed.\n"

        "abstract":"\nWe present the growth of high aspect ratio copper nanowires with diameters of about 100 nm and a length of up to several micrometers via directed electrochemical nanowire assembly (DENA). We demonstrate that the nanowire morphology is controlled by the metal salt solution concentration and by the amplitude and frequency of the applied alternating voltage. The frequency was found to notably affect the nanowire diameter. The impact of the process parameters on the nanowire growth is discussed on the basis of the Butler\u2013Volmer equation. The presented results for the bottom-up fabrication of copper wires are of high interest for nanosensor design, particularly for developing highly sensitive gas sensors. We suggest guidelines for the formation of copper nanowires based on experimental and theoretical considerations.\n"

The influence of flow rates on copper particle diameter, morphology, size distribution, and elemental compositions has been investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that copper nanoparticles were uniform in size distribution, without being oxidized. With the increase in fluid flow rate the copper nanoparticles mean diameter increased, and the surface plasmon resonance absorptions of copper nanoparticles exhibited slight blue-shifting.\n"

        "abstract":"\nThe electrochemical nucleation and growth kinetics of copper nanoparticles on a Ni electrode have been studied with cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry in the choline chloride (ChCl)\u2013urea based deep eutectic solvent (DES). The copper source was introduced into the solvent by the dissolution of Cu(I) oxide (Cu2O). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the electroreduction of Cu(I) species in the DES is a diffusion-controlled quasi-reversible process. The analysis of the chronoamperometric transient behavior during electrodeposition suggests that the deposition of copper on the Ni electrode at low temperatures follows a progressive nucleation and three-dimensional growth controlled by diffusion. The effect of temperature on the diffusion coefficient of Cu(I) species that is present in the solvent and electron transfer rate constant obeys the Arrhenius law, according to which the activation energies are estimated to be 49.20 and 21.72 kJ mol\u22121, respectively. The initial stage of morphological study demonstrates that both electrode potential and temperature play important roles in controlling the nucleation and growth kinetics of the nanocrystals during the electrodeposition process. Electrode potential is observed to affect mainly the nucleation process, whereas temperature makes a major contribution to the growth process.\n"

        "abstract":"\nBimodal sized elemental copper (Cu) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized from inexpensive oxidized copper salts by an extracellular metal-reduction process using anaerobic Thermoanaerobacter sp. X513 bacteria in aqueous solution. The bacteria nucleate NPs outside of the cell, and they control the Cu2+ reduction rate to form uniform crystallites with an average diameter of 1.75 \u00b1 0.46 \u03bcm after 3 days incubation. To control the size and enhance the air stability of Cu NPs, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with nitrilotriacetic acid as a chelator, and the surfactant capping agents oleic acid, oleylamine, ascorbic acid, or L-cysteine. Time-dependent UV-visible absorption measurements and XPS studies indicated well-suspended, bimodal colloidal Cu NPs (70\u2013150 and 5\u201310 nm) with extended air-stability up to 300 min and stable Cu NP film surfaces with 14% oxidation after 20 days. FTIR spectroscopy suggested that these capping agents were effectively adsorbed on the NP surface providing oxidation resistance under aqueous and dry conditions. Compared to previously reported Cu NP syntheses, this biological process substantially reduced the requirement for hazardous organic solvents and chemical reducing agents, while reducing the levels of Cu oxide impurities in the product. This process was highly reproducible and scalable from 0.01 to 1 L batches.\n"
